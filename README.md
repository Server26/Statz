# Statz-neo

A fork of [straatvin's Statz](https://github.com/Staartvin/Statz) plugin for Server26. This is a "life support" version. Its sole purpose is to service existing data from the original version to player on Server26. Any issues **not** affecting the plugins functionality and security on Server26 are considered out of scope for this project.

## Changes to the Original

The main difference to the originla plugin is that all cross plugin compatibility aside from Vault, Worldgurad, PAPI, and Griefprvention have been removed. The ability to click on the plugins chat messages has been restored. It was broken in 1.20 due to Minecraft/Bukkit reworking the chat system.

## TL;DR

- Clickable messages work

- Won't fix anything else
